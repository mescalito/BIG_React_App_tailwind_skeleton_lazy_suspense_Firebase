# Instagram from Scratch with  React, Tailwind CSS, Firebase
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mescalito/BIG_React_App_tailwind_skeleton_lazy_suspense_Firebase/master/instagram-preview.png">

# ðŸ“£ Summary

This application (Instagram clone) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Tailwind CSS. I have built the following pages within this application: login, sign up, dashboard & lastly the user profile page. There are four different pages, some are public and some are private with auth listeners. Firebase firestore handles all the data, and that data is retrieved using a custom hook.

I used Tailwind CSS for this project and I really enjoyed using it.

# To Improve
- Crear una CONSTANTE que determine cuantos comentarios se muestran por fafault por foto, actualmente se muestran 3 (compnents/post/comments)
- crear un debaunce en el login page cuando se esta llenando el email de autenticacion para q no se haga render cada vez q se escribe algo en el input
- Cuando un usuario autenticado en el sistema intenta navegar a un route como /login lo redirecciona al dashboard, ya q no hay necesidad de mostrarle /login
